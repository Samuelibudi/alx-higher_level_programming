Task 5: An empty class BaseGeometry.

Task 6: A class BaseGeometry based on class in Task 5.

Task 7: A class BaseGeometry based on class in Task 6.

Task 8: A class Rectangle that inherits from BaseGeometry in Task 7.

Task 9: A class Rectangle that inherits from BaseGeometry in Task 8.

Task 10: A class Square that inherits from Rectangle.
